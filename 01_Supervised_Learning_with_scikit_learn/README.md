# Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

---

Supervised learning is analogous to training a child to walk. You will hold the child’s hand, show him how to take his foot forward, walk yourself for a demonstration and so on, until the child learns to walk on his own.


## Regression
Similarly, in the case of supervised learning, you give concrete known examples to the computer. You say that for given feature value $x_1$ the output is $y_1$, for $x_2$ it is $y_2$, for $x_3$ it is $y_3$, and so on. Based on this data, you let the computer figure out an empirical
relationship between $x$ and $y$.

Once the machine is trained in this way with a sufficient number of data points, now you would ask the machine to predict $Y$ for a given $X$. Assuming that you know the real value of $Y$ for this given $X$, you will be able to deduce whether the machine’s prediction is correct. 

Thus, you will test whether the machine has learned by using the known test data. Once you are satisfied that the machine is able to do the predictions with a desired level of accuracy (say 80 to 90%) you can stop further training the machine.

Now, you can safely use the machine to do the predictions on unknown data points, or ask the machine to predict $Y$ for a given $X$ for which you do not know the real value of $Y$. This training comes under the regression.

## Classification
You may also use machine learning techniques for classification problems. In classification problems, you classify objects of similar nature into a single group. For example, in a set of 100 students say, you may like to group them into three groups based on their heights - short, medium and long. Measuring the height of each student, you will place them in a proper group.

Now, when a new student comes in, you will put him in an appropriate group by measuring
his height. By following the principles in regression training, you will train the machine to classify a student based on his feature – the height. When the machine learns how the groups are formed, it will be able to classify any unknown new student correctly. Once again, you would use the test data to verify that the machine has learned your technique of classification before putting the developed model in production.

Supervised Learning is where the AI really began its journey. This technique was applied successfully in several cases. You have used this model while doing the hand-written recognition on your machine. Several algorithms have been developed for supervised learning.
